        "\n",
        "The job market for data-related work is changing very fast. Many companies need data analysts, data scientists, and AI engineers to help them work with information and make better decisions. Because these jobs are new and very different from traditional office jobs, people often do not know what a “fair salary” should be. Salaries can also be very different between countries, companies, and job titles. For example, a data scientist in one country may earn much more than a data analyst in another place, even if they have similar skills.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the last few years, many global events also changed the job market. The pandemic has made remote working more common around the world, and more companies have adjusted their salary levels in this period of time. New technologies, such as the rise of artificial intelligence, have also changed skill requirements, which has had a significant impact on salary expectations. With these changes, it is important to understand the factors that affect salary levels in all occupations, including data-related occupations. A clear view of these factors can help job seekers make better decisions and help employers create fair and competitive salary plans.\n"

        "Salary levels in data-related jobs are very different across countries, companies, and job roles. Some studies show that factors such as company size, company location, job title and experience can create strong differences in salaries (Ramkumar et al., 2024). Because of this, job seekers often do not know what a fair salary is, and employers also find it difficult to set the right pay.\n",
        "\n",
        "Global events also created more problems. Research shows that COVID-19 changed skill needs in the labour market and affected salary patterns (Juarez & Villaseñor, 2024). Other studies explain that the Russia–Ukraine war caused economic instability, which also influenced job markets (Semenenko et al., 2024). New AI tools, such as ChatGPT, also changed job structures and created uncertainty in many occupations (Zarifhonarvar, 2023; Johnston & Makridis, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of all these factors, it is difficult to understand which variables have the biggest effect on salaries in data-related jobs. There is a need for a clear model that shows the important features and explains how external events may change salary patterns.\n"

        "**Organizational factors**\n",
        "\n",
        "Organizational factors include company size, location, industry, and pay structure. The salary factor list explains that larger companies or companies in profitable industries usually offer higher pay. Some research also supports this idea. For example, Khosa et al. (2024) show that company location and size significantly affect entry-level salaries in global labour markets.\n",

        "**Job-related factors**\n",

        "These factors include job complexity, responsibility, and skill requirements. In the factor list, jobs with higher responsibility or expert skills usually receive higher pay. This point is also seen in Lu et al. (2025), who found that technical skill requirements in big-data roles strongly influence salary levels in job advertisements.\n",

        "**Individual factors**\n",

        "Individual factors relate to education, experience, skills, and gender. Mamun (2024) shows that personal characteristics affect wages at different levels of the wage distribution.

        "The fast growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has changed many job markets, including data-related roles. Several studies show that AI brings both new opportunities and new risks for salaries in technical jobs. Murme et al. (2025) explain that AI automation reduces some routine work, but at the same time increases the value of advanced technical skills. This means that some job roles may lose salary power, while others may become more valuable.\n",
        "\n",
        "A key change happened after the release of large language models such as ChatGPT. According to Zarifhonarvar (2023), ChatGPT can fully affect more than 30% of occupations and partially influence over 36% of them. The study explains that many text-based and analytical tasks can now be completed faster with AI. This creates uncertainty in salary growth for mid-level roles, while senior roles that require decision-making or domain expertise may still keep strong salary levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Student perception studies also support this view. Gomes and Brito (2025) show that students in technical fields see AI as helpful for learning and productivity, but they also worry that some traditional roles may disappear.

        "Machine learning is widely used in HR analytics because it helps organisations understand patterns in salaries and make better decisions. Several studies show that ML models can analyse many job-related and personal factors at the same time and estimate pay levels with good accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ayua et al. (2023) used polynomial regression to predict salaries of non-academic staff. Their work showed that non-linear models can capture complex relationships between experience, job level and salary (Ayua, Malgwi and Afrifa, 2023). This supports the idea that salary patterns are not always linear and may depend on combinations of factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other researchers focused on multiple linear regression for predicting salaries in technology jobs. In Maidin, Yi and Ayyasy (2024) study, they used job locations and mix them with skill variables to build a salary prediction model for AI professionals. The results of this study shown that both geographic differences and technical skills had strong influence on predicted salary values, and linear models could explain a large part of this variation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning is also used to explore general salary trends for data jobs, and it applied linear regression to a data-science salary dataset and highlighted how variables such as job title and experience level affect salary. Some studies reported that simple ML models can still provide useful predictions when the dataset is large and well-structured (Deb, 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "More advanced work shown the importance of optimisation and hyperparameter tuning. These workings are studied different regression models in scikit-learn and showed that tuning hyperparameters significantly improves model performance. Results suggest that optimisation steps, even for basic algorithms, can reduce errors and produce more stable predictions (Salama, 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature selection is another important area in Machine Learning based salary analysis. Arifin and Adiyono (2024) examined how hyperparameter tuning improves model accuracy in predicting student performance, but their findings also show the importance of selecting the right input variables. This is useful for salary prediction because more accurate models require careful choice of features such as job role, experience, company size or remote work level (Arifin and Adiyono, 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these studies show that ML techniques such as linear regression, polynomial regression, and tuned regression models are widely used in HR analytics and salary prediction. The literature suggests that models become more accurate when:\n",

They want to know if the salary they receive is fair compared to others with the same skills or experience. Many people in the labour market face uncertainty because salary levels are very different across companies and countries, and this makes decision-making difficult. Clear predictions can help them understand their value better.\n",

HR teams can use prediction results to check if the salary they offer is competitive or if changes are needed.\n",

        "One question is about the factors that create salary differences. For example, they want to know if the job title is more important, or the experience level. They also wonder if the size of the company or the company location has a stronger effect. Companies need this information to offer fair and correct salaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another question is about the influence of external events on the job market. During the COVID-19 period, many jobs changed. Later, with new AI tools such as ChatGPT, some skills became more valuable and some tasks became easier. Companies want to understand if these changes increased or decreased salaries in data-related roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Organizations also want to know which skills help employees earn higher salaries, and if remote work has changed salary levels. This is important for HR planning because many companies are still deciding between office work, hybrid work, and remote work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finding answers to these questions helps companies make better decisions about hiring, salary budgets, and employee retention. This project uses data analysis and machine learning to give clear information about these topics. The goal is to show where salaries are aligned with the market and where companies may need to review their salary strategy.\n"

        "\n",
        "Salary prediction models can help HR teams make decisions in a more clear and structured way. In many companies, HR managers must decide how much to offer for new positions, how to adjust salaries for current employees, and how to plan salary budgets for the next year. These decisions are difficult when there is not enough information about the job market.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"A prediction model gives HR a simple tool to understand what a fair salary looks like for a specific role.\" (Nicole, 2025). When HR enters job details such as job title, experience level, company size, or location, the model can estimate a realistic salary range. This helps companies avoid offering salaries that are too low or too high.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another benefit is fairness. If similar jobs inside the company receive very different salaries, employees may feel that the system is not fair. A prediction model can show HR which jobs are outside the normal market range. This helps HR adjust salaries in a more transparent and objective way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Salary prediction also supports planning. HR teams need to prepare budgets for new projects, new teams, or expansions into other countries. With a prediction model, they can see how salaries change in different regions or job roles. This makes long-term planning easier and reduces financial risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model can also help HR understand how external events may affect salaries. For example, during COVID-19 or after the appearance of new AI tools, some roles became more expensive because the demand increased. By looking at salary trends from 2020 to 2025, HR can prepare better for future changes in the labor market.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, salary prediction supports HR strategy by giving clear, data-based information. Instead of relying only on intuition or past salary tables, companies can use real data to make decisions that are fair, consistent, and aligned with market conditions.\n"

        "\n",
        "The success of this project is not only about building an accurate model. It also depends on whether the results can be useful for the people who will use them. For this reason, several criteria are considered to measure the real value of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first criterion is prediction accuracy. The model should estimate salary levels with a reasonable level of error. Metrics such as MAE and R² help to check how close the predictions are to real values. After accuracy, clarity of the results is important. It is not enough to give a number; users should also see which factors—such as experience, job title, company size, or location—had the strongest influence on the prediction. Tools like feature importance and SHAP make this easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important criterion is practical usefulness. If HR teams can use the model to check whether their salary offers match the market, or if job seekers can understand what affects their expected salary, then the model has real value.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model should also prove that it works not only on the original dataset. Testing it on an external dataset shows whether it performs well in real-world situations. This is especially important when the job market changes because of major events such as COVID-19, the Russia–Ukraine war, or the rise of AI tools.\n",
        "At the end, when the model help to make better decisions about salaries, recruitment, and workforce planning, and if it helps individuals understand the factors that shape their earnings, we can say the model is successful.\n"

        "\n",
        "Real salary data always comes with some gaps. Many datasets only show the main salary and leave out things like bonuses or other benefits that people get during the year. Because of this, the numbers we see are not always the full picture of a person’s income.\n",
        "\n",
        "Job titles are another problem. Companies often use their own naming style, so the same title might mean different tasks in different places. Sometimes two jobs look different on paper but are almost the same in real work. This makes comparing roles across companies a bit confusing.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are also issues inside the data itself. Some records have missing parts, and some information is entered by people manually. This can lead to small errors, or sometimes the data does not match perfectly with what happens in real life.\n",
        "\n",
        "Salary levels also change because of things that are not written in the dataset. Events like inflation, political decisions, or sudden changes in the market can affect salaries, but the dataset cannot show these reasons. We only see the numbers going up or down without knowing the background.\n",
        "\n",
        "Besides these, some personal factors—such as negotiation skills or the rules inside a company—cannot be measured in a simple file. These things matter in real salary decisions but stay invisible when we look only at the data.\n"

More than 84,000 records come from the US, while the second and third positions (Canada and the United Kingdom) are far behind, with only a few thousand entries. The remaining countries appear with very small counts.\n",

        "This uneven distribution suggests that the dataset mainly reflects the North American technology labour market. Because of this concentration, many patterns observed in later analysis—such as salary levels or remote-work behaviour—will naturally be influenced by the US market. This point needs to be kept in mind when interpreting the findings in the next chapters.\n"

        "When comparing the dataset with the main groups of salary factors mentioned in the literature, some parts match well while others are missing. The job-related factors are the clearest ones. We have job title, experience level, and employment type, and these already show different levels of responsibility or skill in the workforce. From the organisational side, company size is included, and it gives some idea about how salaries may differ between small, medium, and large firms. The location of the company can also be linked to living costs or general market conditions, even though it is not explained in detail in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, several important factors are not present. The data does not include education level, certificates, or personal skills, so individual differences cannot be studied properly. Wider economic and social influences—such as inflation, labour rules, or fairness issues—are also not part of the dataset. Because of these missing elements, the data cannot fully reflect all salary drivers, but the variables that are available still help us understand the main structural patterns in data-related jobs."

        "Our main dataset still has several limits that can influence the analysis. One of the biggest is the high number of duplicated rows. When many records appear more than once, some job titles or salary levels become over-represented, and this can push the results in a certain direction. Another limit is the wide spread of job titles. Some titles have thousands of records but others only a few, so comparisons across all roles are not always balanced.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset also misses many personal factors that usually affect salaries, such as education level, certificates, or specific technical skills. Because of this, the model can only work with general patterns and not with deeper individual differences. The same happens with company information: we know the company size, but we do not know the industry, internal pay policy, or financial strength, which are usually important in salary studies.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is also a geographical bias. Most records come from the United States, while many other countries have very small samples. This means the results of the model will naturally be closer to US salary patterns and may not represent other regions well. Finally, some extreme salary values exist in the data, and even though they are real entries, they may influence model behaviour if not handled carefully.\n",

        "Overall, the dataset is useful for building salary prediction models, but the missing variables and imbalanced distributions can limit how widely the results can be interpreted.\n"

Its performance on the test set showed a MAE of about 51,132 USD and an R² value of 0.19, meaning that it explained only a small portion of the variation in salaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second model was a Decision Tree Regressor. Decision trees are able to capture non-linear relationships, so they usually perform slightly better than linear models. In this case, the tree produced a MAE of around 50,867 USD with an R² of 0.19, which is only a minor improvement over the linear model. The limited gain suggests that the dataset has a high level of variation that a single tree cannot fully capture.\n",
        "\n",
        "The third model was a Random Forest Regressor, which averages many trees to reduce overfitting. Random Forest model achieved the best results between these three models, with a MAE of 50,764 USD and an R² of 0.19. Although the improvement is small, the model is more stable and provides a better base for the next steps, such as hyperparameter tuning and feature importance analysis.\n"

This means that, in this dataset, the employee’s level in the job hierarchy has the largest effect on salary changes. The second most important factor is employee_residence_US, which suggests that jobs linked to the United States show noticeably higher salary levels.\n",

These patterns may reflect existing inequalities in the labour market, and the model may reproduce them if they are not interpreted carefully. Third, because some job groups appear much more often than others, the model naturally becomes more accurate for larger groups. This limitation must be communicated clearly to anyone who uses the results. Finally, no personal identifiers were included in the dataset, which reduces privacy risks, but any real-world application should follow standard data-protection rules."

        "All parts of project was implemented in Google Colab, which provides a cloud-based Python environment with all required libraries already available. Using Colab helped keep the work reproducible, because the code runs the same way on any device without needing a local installation. A fixed Python version and a stable set of packages were used, and these packages were also listed inside the project’s requirements.txt file. This makes it possible for anyone to recreate the same environment if they want to run the notebook outside Colab.\n",

Running the notebook from the first cell to the last one produces the same outputs every time, including the saved charts and the trained model results.\n",
        "\n",
        "To support full reproducibility, all figures and important outputs (such as SHAP results) were exported and stored in the Figures folder in the GitHub repository. This means that even if the notebook is not executed, readers can still see all generated results. Using a public GitHub repository also ensures transparency: both the raw data and the processed results are available, and all steps of the analysis can be reviewed or repeated by other researchers.\n"

Each model learned the relationship between the features and the salary values in the training set.\n",

Each model produced a list of predicted salary values, which were then compared with the real salaries. The Random Forest model gave the most stable results among the three, although the difference between the models was small. These predictions were later used to calculate MAE and R² scores, which show how well each model performs.\n"

The Decision Tree model performed almost the same, with an MAE near 50,867 USD and an R² of 0.19. The Random Forest model had the best scores among the three. Its MAE was about 50,764 USD, and its R² reached 0.19, which was the highest.\n",
