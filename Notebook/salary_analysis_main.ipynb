        "\n",
        "This project examined how salaries in data-related jobs change across different countries, levels of experience, and work conditions. The main focus was to understand the factors behind salary differences and to build a machine-learning model that can estimate salary ranges. The study used a large international dataset covering the years 2020 to 2025, and several new features were created to make the dataset more suitable for analysis, such as seniority level, remote-work category, and indicators for post-COVID and post-AI periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "In my project several models were tested, and the Random Forest model showed the most stable performance, even though the overall accuracy remained modest. The model’s behaviour was interpreted using SHAP, which helped identify the features that influence predictions the most. Seniority level was the strongest driver, followed by the employee’s country of residence. As in previous researches which found experience and geography are important factors, in my research support this idea as well in salary variation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project also analysed salary trends over time. The results showed a clear increase from 2022 onward, with 2023–2025 showing the highest levels. These patterns match global changes in the job market, including the long-term impact of COVID-19, the rise of remote work, and the growing influence of AI tools such as ChatGPT.\n",
        "\n",
        "To check how well the model generalises, it was tested on an external dataset. The model showed similar patterns but with larger errors because the external dataset had different structures and salary distributions. This confirmed both the strengths and limits of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the project provides practical insights for HR teams, employers, and job seekers. While salary prediction cannot be fully precise, the results help identify the main drivers of salary differences and offer a clearer picture of how the data job market has changed from 2020 to 2025."

        "\n",
        "The job market for data-related work is changing very fast. Many companies need data analysts, data scientists, and AI engineers to help them work with information and make better decisions. Because these jobs are new and very different from traditional office jobs, people often do not know what a “fair salary” should be. Salaries can also be very different between countries, companies, and job titles. For example, a data scientist in one country may earn much more than a data analyst in another place, even if they have similar skills.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the last few years, many global events also changed the job market. The pandemic has made remote working more common around the world, and more companies have adjusted their salary levels in this period of time. New technologies, such as the rise of artificial intelligence, have also changed skill requirements, which has had a significant impact on salary expectations. With these changes, it is important to understand the factors that affect salary levels in all occupations, including data-related occupations. A clear view of these factors can help job seekers make better decisions and help employers create fair and competitive salary plans."

        "Salary levels in data-related jobs are very different across countries, companies, and job roles. Some studies show that factors such as company size, company location, job title and experience can create strong differences in salaries. Because of this, job seekers often do not know what a fair salary is, and employers also find it difficult to set the right pay.\n",

        "Global events also created more problems for the labour market. The COVID-19 pandemic changed skill needs and salary patterns in many jobs. Semenenko et al. (2024) also show that the Russia–Ukraine war caused serious economic instability in Russia, which can influence growth, living standards and job opportunities. New AI tools, such as ChatGPT, also changed job structures and created uncertainty in many occupations.\n",

        "Because of all these factors, it is difficult to understand which variables have the biggest effect on salaries in data-related jobs. There is a need for a clear model that shows the important features and explains how external events may change salary patterns.\n",

        "**Organizational factors**\n",
        "\n",
        "Organizational factors include company size, location, industry and pay structure. Many salary reports say that bigger companies or companies in profitable industries usually offer higher pay. Recent research also supports this idea. For example, Khosa et al. (2024) use the Global Salary 2024 dataset and find that company location and size have a strong effect on entry-level salaries in global labour markets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Job-related factors**\n",
        "\n",
        "These factors include job complexity, responsibility, and skill requirements. In the factor list, jobs with higher responsibility or expert skills usually receive higher pay. This point is also seen in Lu et al. (2025), who found that technical skill requirements in big-data roles strongly influence salary levels in job advertisements.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Individual factors**\n",
        "\n",
        "Many studies show that individual factors such as education, work experience, technical skills, and gender can influence wages. These personal characteristics can affect how much people earn in both lower-paid and higher-paid positions.\n",
        "In the medical sector, Ramkumar et al. (2024) found a clear gender pay gap. Even after controlling for case volume, practice type, and years in practice, women surgeons still earned about 14% less than men.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Economic and market factors**\n",
        "\n",
        "These include labour supply, economic stability, inflation, and labour laws. For example, Goerke and Pannenberg (2025) show that minimum-wage compliance depends on economic and legal conditions inside firms.\n",

In a study from Mexico, it was written that COVID-19 reduced labour market participation for women with children and increased job instability (Juarez & Villaseñor, 2024). This shows that a large crisis can affect job access, working hours, and also salary patterns.\n",

When the economy becomes unstable, salaries in some sectors may change as well, mainly in countries that are close to the conflict or have strong trade links with it. International tech companies can also feel these changes because exchange rates, inflation, and investment plans become less predictable.

AI automation reduces some routine work, but at the same time increases the value of advanced technical skills. This means that some job roles may lose salary power, while others may become more valuable.\n",
        "\n",
        "A noticeable change appeared after tools like ChatGPT entered the workplace. In Zarifhonarvar’s study (2024), he explains that these systems may fully influence a large group of jobs and partly affect many others. The main reason is that tasks based on writing, reading or basic analysis can now be done much faster than before. Because of this shift, some mid-level positions may face slower salary growth, while roles that rely on judgement, experience or decision-making usually keep a stronger salary level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Student perception studies also support this view. Gomes and Brito (2025) show that students in technical fields see AI as helpful for learning and productivity, but they also worry that some traditional roles may disappear.

        "\n",
        "Ayua et al. (2023) used polynomial regression to predict salaries of non-academic staff. Their work showed that non-linear models can capture complex relationships between experience, job level and salary (Ayua, Malgwi and Afrifa, 2023). This supports the idea that salary patterns are not always linear and may depend on combinations of factors.\n",

        "Other researchers also used multiple linear regression to study salary patterns in technology jobs. In the study by Maidin and Ayyasy (2025), the model used job location, experience level and technical skill information to predict salaries for AI professionals. Their findings show that location and experience have a strong effect on salary, while technical skills only add a small improvement. The model still explained a large part of the salary differences, which supports the use of linear models for this type of analysis.\n",

        "In salary prediction for data-related jobs, several groups are involved, and each group needs different types of information. The first group is job seekers. They want to know if the salary they receive is fair compared to others with the same skills or experience. Many people in the labour market face uncertainty because salary levels are very different across companies and countries, and this makes decision-making difficult. Clear predictions can help them understand their value better.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second group is HR teams. HR departments often need to plan budgets, decide pay ranges, and reduce unfair differences in salaries. Salary differences can come from many factors such as experience, job role, company size, and work conditions. HR teams can use prediction results to check if the salary they offer is competitive or if changes are needed.\n",

        "The last group is companies and managers. Companies want to attract skilled employees, especially in data jobs where the demand is high. Forecasting salary levels can help employers to design better hiring strategies and understand market changes, especially during events like COVID-19 or economic surprises. In general, all these groups can benefit from a model that explains how salary patterns change and which factors matter most.\n",

        "\n",
        "In companies that work with data jobs, making decisions about salaries is not always easy. The job market changes very fast, and the required skills also change from year to year. Because of this, managers and HR teams often face a few important questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "One question is about the factors that create salary differences. For example, they want to know if the job title is more important, or the experience level. They also wonder if the size of the company or the company location has a stronger effect. Companies need this information to offer fair and correct salaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another question is about the influence of external events on the job market. During the COVID-19 period, many jobs changed. Later, with new AI tools such as ChatGPT, some skills became more valuable and some tasks became easier. Companies want to understand if these changes increased or decreased salaries in data-related roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Organizations also want to know which skills help employees earn higher salaries, and if remote work has changed salary levels. This is important for HR planning because many companies are still deciding between office work, hybrid work, and remote work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finding answers to these questions helps companies make better decisions about hiring, salary budgets, and employee retention. This project uses data analysis and machine learning to give clear information about these topics. The goal is to show where salaries are aligned with the market and where companies may need to review their salary strategy.\n",

        "\n",
        "Salary prediction models can help HR teams make decisions in a more clear and structured way. In many companies, HR managers must decide how much to offer for new positions, how to adjust salaries for current employees, and how to plan salary budgets for the next year. These decisions are difficult when there is not enough information about the job market.\n",
        "\n",
        "A prediction model gives HR a simple tool to understand what a fair salary looks like for a specific role. When HR enters job details such as job title, experience level, company size, or location, the model can estimate a realistic salary range. This helps companies avoid offering salaries that are too low or too high.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another benefit is fairness. If similar jobs inside the company receive very different salaries, employees may feel that the system is not fair. A prediction model can show HR which jobs are outside the normal market range. This helps HR adjust salaries in a more transparent and objective way.\n",
        "Salary prediction also supports planning. HR teams need to prepare budgets for new projects, new teams, or expansions into other countries. With a prediction model, they can see how salaries change in different regions or job roles. This makes long-term planning easier and reduces financial risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model can also help HR understand how external events may affect salaries. For example, during COVID-19 or after the appearance of new AI tools, some roles became more expensive because the demand increased. By looking at salary trends from 2020 to 2025, HR can prepare better for future changes in the labor market.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, salary prediction supports HR strategy by giving clear, data-based information. Instead of relying only on intuition or past salary tables, companies can use real data to make decisions that are fair, consistent, and aligned with market conditions.\n",

        "\n",
        "The first criterion is prediction accuracy. The model should estimate salary levels with a reasonable level of error. Metrics such as MAE and R² help to check how close the predictions are to real values. After accuracy, clarity of the results is important. It is not enough to give a number; users should also see which factors—such as experience, job title, company size, or location—had the strongest influence on the prediction. Tools like feature importance and SHAP make this easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important criterion is practical usefulness. If HR teams can use the model to check whether their salary offers match the market, or if job seekers can understand what affects their expected salary, then the model has real value.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model should also prove that it works not only on the original dataset. Testing it on an external dataset shows whether it performs well in real-world situations. This is especially important when the job market changes because of major events such as COVID-19, the Russia–Ukraine war, or the rise of AI tools.\n",
        "At the end, when the model help to make better decisions about salaries, recruitment, and workforce planning, and if it helps individuals understand the factors that shape their earnings, we can say the model is successful.\n",

        "\n",
        "Job titles are another problem. Companies often use their own naming style, so the same title might mean different tasks in different places. Sometimes two jobs look different on paper but are almost the same in real work. This makes comparing roles across companies a bit confusing. There are also issues inside the data itself. Some records have missing parts, and some information is entered by people manually. This can lead to small errors, or sometimes the data does not match perfectly with what happens in real life.\n",
        "\n",
        "Salary levels also change because of things that are not written in the dataset. Events like inflation, political decisions, or sudden changes in the market can affect salaries, but the dataset cannot show these reasons. We only see the numbers going up or down without knowing the background.\n",
        "\n",

More than 84,000 records come from the US, while the second and third positions (Canada and the United Kingdom) are far behind, with only a few thousand entries. The remaining countries appear with very small counts.\n",

        "This uneven distribution suggests that the dataset mainly reflects the North American technology labour market. Because of this concentration, many patterns observed in later analysis—such as salary levels or remote-work behaviour—will naturally be influenced by the US market. This point needs to be kept in mind when interpreting the findings in the next chapters.\n"

        "When comparing the dataset with the main groups of salary factors mentioned in the literature, some parts match well while others are missing. The job-related factors are the clearest ones. We have job title, experience level, and employment type, and these already show different levels of responsibility or skill in the workforce. From the organisational side, company size is included, and it gives some idea about how salaries may differ between small, medium, and large firms. The location of the company can also be linked to living costs or general market conditions, even though it is not explained in detail in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, several important factors are not present. The data does not include education level, certificates, or personal skills, so individual differences cannot be studied properly. Wider economic and social influences—such as inflation, labour rules, or fairness issues—are also not part of the dataset. Because of these missing elements, the data cannot fully reflect all salary drivers, but the variables that are available still help us understand the main structural patterns in data-related jobs."

        "Our main dataset still has several limits that can influence the analysis. One of the biggest is the high number of duplicated rows. When many records appear more than once, some job titles or salary levels become over-represented, and this can push the results in a certain direction. Another limit is the wide spread of job titles. Some titles have thousands of records but others only a few, so comparisons across all roles are not always balanced.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset also misses many personal factors that usually affect salaries, such as education level, certificates, or specific technical skills. Because of this, the model can only work with general patterns and not with deeper individual differences. The same happens with company information: we know the company size, but we do not know the industry, internal pay policy, or financial strength, which are usually important in salary studies.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is also a geographical bias. Most records come from the United States, while many other countries have very small samples. This means the results of the model will naturally be closer to US salary patterns and may not represent other regions well. Finally, some extreme salary values exist in the data, and even though they are real entries, they may influence model behaviour if not handled carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the dataset is useful for building salary prediction models, but the missing variables and imbalanced distributions can limit how widely the results can be interpreted.\n",

        "The second model was a Decision Tree Regressor. Decision trees are able to capture non-linear relationships, so they usually perform slightly better than linear models. In this case, the tree produced a MAE of around 50,867 USD with an R² of 0.19, which is only a minor improvement over the linear model. The limited gain suggests that the dataset has a high level of variation that a single tree cannot fully capture.\n",

        "The third model was a Random Forest Regressor, which averages many trees to reduce overfitting. Random Forest model achieved the best results between these three models, with a MAE of 50,764 USD and an R² of 0.19. Although the improvement is small, the model is more stable and provides a better base for the next steps, such as hyperparameter tuning and feature importance analysis."

        "When working with salary data and predictive models, several ethical points must be considered. First of all, salary predictions should not be used to justify unfair pay decisions. The goal of this project is to support transparency, not to replace human judgement. Second, the dataset contains differences between countries, job levels, and remote-work categories. These patterns may reflect existing inequalities in the labour market, and the model may reproduce them if they are not interpreted carefully. Third, because some job groups appear much more often than others, the model naturally becomes more accurate for larger groups. This limitation must be communicated clearly to anyone who uses the results. Finally, no personal identifiers were included in the dataset, which reduces privacy risks, but any real-world application should follow standard data-protection rules."

Using Colab helped keep the work reproducible, because the code runs the same way on any device without needing a local installation. A fixed Python version and a stable set of packages were used, and these packages were also listed inside the project’s requirements.txt file. This makes it possible for anyone to recreate the same environment if they want to run the notebook outside Colab.\n",

This means that even if the notebook is not executed, readers can still see all generated results.

Each model produced a list of predicted salary values, which were then compared with the real salaries. The Random Forest model gave the most stable results among the three, although the difference between the models was small.

The model behaved normally on the data it was trained on, but when I used it on the new dataset, the errors became much larger. One simple reason is that the external dataset includes many developers from countries where salaries are usually high, especially the United States. Because of that, the actual salaries in the external file were much higher than the model expected, so the predictions often came out too low.\n",

So, the reliability is good inside the original environment, but it becomes weaker when the data comes from another place or has very different salary levels."

        "Other features, such as work year, remote ratio, and the type of work setting (remote, hybrid, on-site), had smaller effects.

        "When I look at the salary patterns in Figures 8.1–8.3, the general direction is easy to see. Pay levels for data jobs are lowest in 2020 and 2021, and after that the numbers go up almost every year. The jump after 2022 is quite strong. Some earlier studies also mention that the early COVID-19 period created a lot of stress in the job market, but later the situation changed and digital jobs became even more important, especially when remote work became common (Tarca et al., 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "The SHAP results from Chapter 5 also match what we said above. People with more experience and workers living in the United States usually earn more money.

        "From 2023 our years overlap with the growing use of tools like ChatGPT. AI can help productivity and may create a bigger gap between workers with strong skills and those who do more routine tasks. In our data, salaries keep rising after 2023, so it seems that the spread of AI has helped experienced data professionals keep a strong position in the job market.\n",

        "\n",
        "This project followed a clear and practical goals: to understand which factors shape salaries in data-related jobs and to test how well a machine-learning model can predict these salaries. The whole analysis was built step by step. First, the dataset was cleaned and prepared, and then several new features were created, such as seniority level, remote-work category, and indicators for post-COVID and post-AI years. These steps made the dataset more suitable for modelling and helped capture the main changes in the job market between 2020 and 2025.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the models were trained, the Random Forest model performed slightly better than the others, although overall accuracy remained modest. The scores showed that salary prediction is not a simple task because salaries depend on many personal and company-level factors that do not appear in the dataset. Even with these limits, the model was able to show which inputs matter most. Seniority level was the strongest feature, followed by the employee’s country of residence. Work year, remote ratio, and some country categories also played smaller roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "SHAP values confirmed these patterns. They showed that changes in salary predictions are mostly explained by seniority and the advantages linked to living or working in certain countries, especially the United States. This explains why some predictions stood far from the real salaries. The differences across countries and company types are large, and the dataset cannot capture everything behind them.\n",
        "\n",
        "The external validation with the StackOverflow dataset helped check how the model behaves on unseen data. Finding results show that the errors were higher because the second dataset has a different structure and salary distribution. Still, the external dataset kept the same pattern: people with more experience and people from high-income countries receive higher predicted salaries. This means the model is consistent, even if it is not fully accurate for real-world prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the salary-trend analysis from 2020 to 2025 showed a clear rise after 2021. Salaries grow strongly in 2022 and continue to increase slightly each year after that. The two special periods—post-COVID (2021 onward) and post-AI (2023 onward)—show smoother and more stable increases. This matches the overall pattern inside the dataset, where technology roles appear to gain value over time.\n",

        "\n",
        "Technically, the results from this project show that feature engineering can make a big and dramatic difference. Mapping experience between seniority levels, creating remote work groups, and adding simple indicators for the post-Covid and post-AI years helped the models read the dataset more clearly. Even though the final accuracy remained limited, the consistency of the model across internal and external validation suggests the preprocessing pipeline was well built.\n",
        "\n",
        "The SHAP analysis also provided practical value. Instead of only looking at accuracy numbers, SHAP helped explain why the model behaves the way it does. It showed that seniority is always the main factor shaping predictions. This is not surprising for us, but it confirms that the model focuses on real and meaningful features. Another practical insight is that the country of residence has a strong influence even after other variables are controlled. This means location still shapes salary expectations in the global tech market.\n",
        "\n",
        "From a business point of view, these results can help HR teams and companies think about salary planning. Even if the model cannot predict exact amounts, it helps identify clusters of workers who are likely to fall into certain salary ranges. It can also show where salary differences are unusually high and help employers check whether these differences are reasonable or need attention. The clear upward trend from 2020 to 2025 also suggests that salaries in data-related fields continue to rise, especially after remote work and AI tools became mainstream.\n",

It only included information reported by individuals and did not include important variables such as the exact job role, industry subgroup, company revenue, benefit packages, bonuses, or performance levels. Salaries in real companies generally depend heavily on these elements, so the model cannot reflect the full picture.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another limitation is the uneven distribution across countries. A large number of observations come from only a few countries, most notably the United States. This makes it difficult for the model to learn stable patterns for smaller countries. The same problem appears in foreign datasets, where the distribution of salaries has a very different shape. Because of these differences, the model’s predictions for foreign data are not close to the true values.\n",
        "\n",
        "A third limitation is that salary forecasts are inherently unstable. Two people with similar skills can receive very different offers depending on negotiations, personal networks, or hiring policies within their company. These elements cannot be captured in any data set. For this reason, even robust models will always show some error in salary predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, COVID-19 and AI indicators are only simple year-based indicators. They cannot capture the deeper, more gradual effects of these events. While year-to-year indicators help identify general patterns, they do not measure the precise impact of these shocks.\n",

        "\n",
        "Future studies and works could improve the model in many different ways. First, adding more detailed features would help increase accuracy. Variables such as job function, industry, company revenue, education, skill levels, and remote-work rules would allow the model to better explain salary differences. These features maybe exist in some public datasets, and merging them with the current dataset could create a stronger foundation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second, applying more advanced models may help, especially gradient-boosting techniques or neural networks that are designed for complex patterns. These models may detect salary structures that Random Forests cannot capture.\n",
        "Third, a more refined analysis of the COVID-19 and AI periods could lead to clearer insights. Instead of using year-based flags, future work could include month-based data or variables describing how companies changed their hiring policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fourth, external validation could be expanded using datasets from Glassdoor or Indeed, where job postings include more details such as job titles and skills. This would help test how well the model generalizes in different environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, future work could explore fairness analysis. Since salary differences across countries and experience levels are large, checking for bias in prediction models can help employers and researchers understand whether the models create or reinforce unfair patterns.\n",
